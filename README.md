# MacraMicia

This projects aims to supply a website for a local macrame artist. 

The main purpose of the website is representation. We want to create a space where the artist can showcase all her artwork and and where she has all her social media appearances in one place.

Further than representation, this website is supposed to enable her to offer courses to be booked through the website and to offer her work for sale.
